I like building for the web, I like building fun things, useful things, and not so useful things ðŸ˜…
The web is my canvas, a canvas where I can build whatever I want and share it with the world, no need to download anything or get locked in a closed ecosystem to use the things I've built, all you need is a URL and an internet connection.

Most of my skills lay in frontend engineering, I know my way around the backend and I have a small niche for design.

I use my skills to help companies build or showcase their products or business on the web and I ensure that it remains performant âš¡, maintainable ðŸ› , accessible â™¿, and maybe add a sprinkle of animation âœ¨.

My current stack is React, Typescript, CSS-in-JS, Next.js, Gatsby.js, GraphQL, and Node.js.
