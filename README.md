### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I like building for the web.

Most of my skills lay in frontend engineering, I know my way around the backend and I have a niche for design.

I use my skills to help companies build their products or business on the web and I ensure that it remains performant âš¡, maintainable ðŸ› , accessible â™¿.

My current stack is React, Typescript, CSS-in-JS, Next.js, Gatsby.js, GraphQL, and Node.js.
